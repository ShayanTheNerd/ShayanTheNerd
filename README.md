Hello there! I'm Shayan, a passionate front-end web developer, optimization enthusiast, and skilled programmer fluent in both Persian and English. While my primary goal is to consistently improve my skills and expand my knowledge, I currently work as a freelance web developer, not only crafting seamless user experiences but also fine-tuning website performance for optimal results. In addition, I take pleasure in sharing my expertise with fellow developers and have been willingly contributing to various developer communities on social media platforms for over a year now.
